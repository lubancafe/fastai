<h4>What is softmax?</h4>
<p><b>softmax</b> is a generalization of logistic function that “squashes”(maps) a K-dimensional vector z of arbitrary real values to a K-dimensional vector σ(z) of real values in the range (0, 1) that add up to 1.
e.g. [2.1, 3.4, 81, 13.5] => [0.021, 0.034, 0.81, 0.135]</p>
